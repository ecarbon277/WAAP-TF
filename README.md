# WAAP-TF
## Automatically Deploy WAAP and Vulnerable Web App
Written by Edmund Carbon_Test


This playbook will install Nginx and Docker on a Ubuntu VM within Azure. 

It will then download [OWASP Juice Shop](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop) and run as a container.

Finally, it will deploy the WAAP and register it.
